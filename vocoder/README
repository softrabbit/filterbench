A little tweaking of the vocoder plugin in LMMS.
"make bench" runs the benchmark, "make compare" checks the output is OK after tweaking.

Step 1. 
Converted the bandpasses from arrays of structs to structs of arrays.
Runtime something like 35-40% less at "-O2 -ftree-vectorize"

Step 2.
Converted the bands_out variable, too. No further gains in speed. 
At -O3 the faster code is is actually slower than at -O2, whereas
the original gains a little from -O2 to -O3 :)

Step 3.
Added inline keyword to vocoder_do_bandpasses(). Now at 45% gains
using "-O2 -ftree-vectorize".

Step 4.
Created variable "sample" to accumulate output from bands in final loop
in runVocoder(), cutting out a bunch of assignments. 50% shorter 
runtime achieved = twice as fast code.
